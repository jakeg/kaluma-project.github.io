## Installing a package

A Github repository is prefered for package distribution (_Don't need to publish to npmjs.org_). A package can be installed easily with NPM: `npm install <github-repo-url>`. For more detail, please check [`npm install`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-install).

**Examples**

```bash
# Install a package from github
$ npm install https://github.com/niklauslee/dht

# Install specific branch or tag
$ npm install https://github.com/niklauslee/dht#v1.0.0
```
